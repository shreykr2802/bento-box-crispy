# bento-box-crispy

So I have gone through many iterations of my website and I wanted to settle on something finally. I had an idea, how about Bento-Box, apparantly it makes everything apealling and how a little crispy look to it?? Hence the name `bento-box-crispy`.


## Features

- Created this to learn Svelte.
- Not the world class code (obviously 🤷🏻).
- Written in Javascript like a 12 year old's code. Who cares about typescript (😰).
- Many issues and not even utlized svelte to its full extent.
